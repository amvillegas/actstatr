@techreport{Diez2013,
abstract = {1. knowledgable about the basics of survival analysis, 2. familiar with vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, plotting, and linear models in R, and 3. interested in applying survival analysis in R. This guide emphasizes the survival package 1 in R 2 . Following very brief introductions to material, functions are introduced to apply the methods. A few short supplemental functions have been written and are available in the OIsurv package 3 , and data sets from the KMsurv package 4 are also used. This guide may be a particularly helpful supplement for Klein and Moeschberger's book, with which KMsurv is associated. Ideally, this survival analysis document would be printed front-to-back and bound like a book. No topics run over two pages. Those that are two pages start on an even page, preventing the need to flip between pages for a single topic. All sample code may be run provided the OIsurv package is loaded, which automatically loads the survival and KMsurv packages. Details about installing and loading the OIsurv package are described in the first section, which discusses R packages.},
